# Pomodorro

This is a Pomodorro timer Application project.

## Main idea

This application is made for better productivity in your everyday coding/programming/computer life. It uses the Pomodorro üçÖ technique: **work hard for 20 minutes and then have a 5 minute rest. Then repeat.**

## Currently supported features

- running timer(default work time: 20 minutes, rest time: 5 minutes)
- Creating an account with username
- Creating tasks _(once you have an account)_
- Deleting tasks _(once you have an account)_
- Changing default times _(once you have an account)_
- Changing username _(once you have an account)_
- Deleting progress _(once you have an account)_
- Deleting all tasks at once _(once you have an account)_
- Deleting account _(once you have an account)_
- Using custom times for tasks(setting times for tasks is not supported yet)

The application is fully responsive: you can use it both on mobile and on tablet or PC.
